      <description>Event Challenge Category Points Solves     ecsc Hello Rootkitty pwn 500 24    TL;DR A custom kernel module was vulnerable to a buffer overflow, with a small ropchain I escalated my privileges to root and with a sys_chmod syscalls I got the flag.
Description    Recon I&amp;rsquo;m not a Linux kernel expert, everything might not be 100% correct, but I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to summarize what I understood.</description>

      <description>Event Challenge Category Points Solves     AperiCtf TMNT web 300 6       TL;DR In this challenge we need to trigger an XSS, first we need to bypass the template engine of the browser to insert custom tags in the page. We can then trigger the XSS with some specific tag and use a DOM-based JavaScript injection vulnerability.
Step 1 This is my first web write-up, I usually prefer popping shell, but this time we will pop some alert boxes !</description>

      <description>Event Challenge Category Points Solves     AperiCtf PwnRunSee 1 pwn 175 5   AperiCtf PwnRunSee 2 pwn 250 2    TL;DR This challenge was a use after free vulnerability which allow the user to get a shell on the remote docker after a call to execve with some user controlled parameters. Once inside the docker, we can abuse some privileges to mount the host disk inside the container and get the last flag.</description>

      <description>Event Challenge Category Points Solves     ecsc2019 filereader pwn 1000 20    TL;DR We need to exploit binary which read the content of files listed in an other file. A buffer-overflow is present in one of the function and we can leak the address of libc thanks to /proc/self/map since we can read files. A onegadget is then used to pop a shell.</description>

      <description>Event Challenge Category Points Solves     inshack-2019 gimme-your-shell pwn 50 67    TL;DR This is a remote buffer overflow challenge, there is no protection on the binary but ASLR is enable on the remote server. I redirected the execution flow to write my shellcode to a controled area, then jump to it and execute it.
Getting informations First I looked at the protections on the binary :</description>

      <description>Event Challenge Category Points Solves     santhacklausctf mi1 Forensic/Crypto 800 18    TL;DR After downloading the zip file we were faced with a linux memory dump. After building the correct profile for volatility you had to perform a known plain text attack on an encrypted and splited zip file to recover the file flag.txt.

      <description>Event Challenge Category Points Solves     santhacklausctf mi2 Forensic/Crypto/network 500 22    TL;DR In the second part of the challenge we also had a memory dump of a Debian system and a network capture. When you analyse the network capture you can see that some data were exfiltrated, if you look into the memdup you can see that the tool DET (Data Exfiltration Toolkit), has been used to exfiltrate the data.</description>
