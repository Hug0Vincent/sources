I'm actually student in computer science in the field of cybersecurity. I didnâ€™t know anything about IT security and hacking few years ago. I first learn with Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA), and then I discovered Root-me. Since then I've learned a lot and I love learning new things and solving some hacking challenges.

I've done this blog to host my write-ups and some posts about privacy or personal hacking stuff. 

Feel free to send me a message to talk about security or Rock-climbing/Slackline or everything else.
